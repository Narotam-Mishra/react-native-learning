## Lec 1 - Introduction (4:08)

Q. What is React Native?
# React Native is an open-source framework for building native Android and iOS applications using React.

# JavaScript to access plateform-specific APIs (such as camera and push notifications)

# React components to define the appearance and behavior of our user interface.

# React itself is a library designed for building user interface

# `react-dom` for web apps and `react-native` for native mobile apps.

Q. Why to learn React Native?
# Traditionally developing an IOS app requires knowledge of `Swift` or `Objective C` whereas building an Android app requires Java or Kotlin expertise. Considering the global distribution of users with approximately 31% on IOS and 68% on Android, we would typically need to develop two separate apps using different technologies to cater to everyone. However, with React Native, we can create an app that works seamlessly on both plateforms. That's why React Native is in high demand in the job market.

# Some poular comapanies using React Native are :- Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Pinterest, Discord and many more.

# Prerequisites - JavaScript, React fundamentals
