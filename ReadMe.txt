# React Native (Codevolution)

## Lec 1 - Introduction (4:08)

Q. What is React Native?
# React Native is an open-source framework for building native Android and iOS applications using React.

# JavaScript to access plateform-specific APIs (such as camera and push notifications)

# React components to define the appearance and behavior of our user interface.

# React itself is a library designed for building user interface

# `react-dom` for web apps and `react-native` for native mobile apps.

Q. Why to learn React Native?
# Traditionally developing an IOS app requires knowledge of `Swift` or `Objective C` whereas building an Android app requires Java or Kotlin expertise. Considering the global distribution of users with approximately 31% on IOS and 68% on Android, we would typically need to develop two separate apps using different technologies to cater to everyone. However, with React Native, we can create an app that works seamlessly on both plateforms. That's why React Native is in high demand in the job market.

# Some poular comapanies using React Native are :- Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Pinterest, Discord and many more.

# Prerequisites - JavaScript, React fundamentals

## Lec 2 - Expo vs React Native (2:45)

# Expo vs React Native :- while both frameworks are allowed for the development of Android and iOS apps they differ significantly in terms of maintenance ease of setup and platform compatibility.

# React Native (RN) is an open-source framework maintained by Meta (Facebook), designed for building cross-platform apps.

# Expo is an open-source framework maintained by Expo itself, designed for building cross-platform apps.

# Unlike plain RN, which can be challenging and time-consuming to set up, Expo provides a streamlined experience. Expo has a suite of tools and services built around React Native, which greatly simplifies the development process.

# If it helps Expo is to React Native how Nextjs is to React.

# Note - With plain Reacgt Native, we cannot build iOS apps on a windows or linux machine. native iOS apps can only be built on a macOS machine.

# With Expo, we can develop our app on windows or linux and run that app on a physical iPhone.

# Expo 

# Expo has evolved significantly over the years and now supports nearly all the features necessary for building mobile apps.

# In the event that we require access to native Android or iOS code, Expo allows us to eject our app and work with a plain React Native codebase. This flexibility ensures that we have the option to leverage the additional functionalities provided by Expo while still retaining the ability to tap into native code when necessary.

# Expo is the default choice for setting up development environment. This endorsement by the React Native community highlights Expo as the optimal starting point for beginners. It provides a smoother onboarding experience and robust set of tools to kick-start our React native journey.
